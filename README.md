# Webpack4 + MarionetteJS + Babel/ES6

This is a modern JS skeleton with MarionetteJS for [Webpack 4](https://webpack.github.io/). This projected was created with [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) v9.4.0

## Getting started

* Install:
    * Inside this folder run: `npm install`
* Run:
    * `npm start` — starts project
    * `npm run build` - builds you project
* Learn:
    * `public/` dir is fully auto-generated and served by HTTP server.  Write your code in `app/` dir.
    * Place static files you want to be copied from `app/assets/` and `app/styles/` to `public/`.
